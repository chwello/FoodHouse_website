                    <span class="change-gray">One of the most important nutrients found in citrus fruits is vitamin C. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps to protect your cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and arthritis. Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons, and limes, are a delicious and nutritious snack option. They are packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can benefit your overall health.</span>

                <div>
                    <span class="change-gray">In addition to vitamin C, citrus fruits are also a good source of potassium, fiber, and folate. Potassium is an essential mineral that helps to regulate blood pressure and muscle function. Fiber helps to keep you feeling full and satisfied after eating, and it can also help to lower cholesterol levels. Folate is a B vitamin that is important for cell growth and development.</span>
